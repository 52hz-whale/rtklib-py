RTKLIB-Py - Python version of RTKLIB

What is RTKLIB-Py
RTKLIB-Py is a free and open source subset of RTKLIB written in Python. It was originally based on CSSRlib but has been rewritten to align very closely with the demo5 version of RTKLIB.  It is a work in progress and currently supports only PPK solutions using GPS and Galileo satellites.
