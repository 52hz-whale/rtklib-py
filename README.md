RTKLIB-Py - Python version of RTKLIB

What is RTKLIB-Py:  
RTKLIB-Py is a free and open source subset of RTKLIB written in Python. It was originally based on CSSRlib but has been rewritten to align very closely with the demo5 version of RTKLIB.  It currently supports only PPK solutions using GPS, GLonass, and Galileo constellations.  The ambiguity resolution algorithms are still incomplete and are more similar to the 2.4.3 version of RTKLIB than the demo5 version.
